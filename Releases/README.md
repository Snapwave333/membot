# Releases

This folder contains release notes scaffolding and templates for upcoming versions of NeoMeme Markets.

Contents:
- `RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md` – A structured template for writing release notes.
- `v1.1.0-notes.md` – A stub file to start drafting the next release.

How to use:
1. Copy `RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md` to a new file named `vX.Y.Z-notes.md` when starting a release.
2. Fill in Highlights, Assets, Upgrade Notes, Known Issues, and Verification Checklist.
3. After publishing, also add a concise summary to `CHANGELOG.md` and link the GitHub Release.

Tip: Keep long-form notes here in `Releases/` and a shorter summary in `CHANGELOG.md`. For web-friendly viewing, you can also mirror or move the final notes under `docs/releases/`.
