# NeoMeme Markets v1.0.1 â€“ Windows installer fix

Release tag: v1.0.1
Date: 2025-10-16

## Highlights
- Windows installer: launcher venv bootstrap now prefers Python 3.12/3.11 over 3.13 to avoid CFFI incompatibilities.
- First-run bootstrap: dependency pins updated for smoother installs.
  - Recommended pins: `solana==0.32.0`, `websockets==11.0`, `solders==0.20.0` (for anchorpy compatibility)
- Build reliability: non-OneDrive build mirror used to avoid file lock/EBUSY issues.
- Docs: README enhancements (ToC, Releases section, DevIcon tech stack, GitHub stats cards, snake graph, troubleshooting tips).
- CI: Added snake contribution graph workflow (Platane/snk), publishing nightly and on push to `output` branch.
