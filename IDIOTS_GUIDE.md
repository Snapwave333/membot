# 🚀 The Ultimate First‑Timer’s Guide to Trading Memecoins: Day One Success

Welcome! This guide is your super‑simple, step‑by‑step roadmap to making your very first safe trade today. We’re keeping it small, we’re keeping it safe, and we’re going to let the bot do the hard work for us.

Golden Rule: Never trade more money than you can easily afford to lose. Start tiny. Discipline wins.

## 1) Get the Trading App (5 Minutes)

Think of this like downloading a new game—the setup is quick because the installer handles almost everything for you.

- Download the Windows installer:
  - Direct installer link: https://github.com/Snapwave333/membot/releases/latest/download/NeoMemeMarkets-Setup.exe
  - Latest release page: https://github.com/Snapwave333/membot/releases/latest
- Install & Open: Run the file you downloaded, then open the app.
- Python Check (usually not needed): If the app asks about Python, don’t worry. The installer is designed to check and fix this automatically. Most people just click Install and they’re good to go. If something’s odd, see the README’s Getting Started section.

## 2) Get Your Digital Wallet Ready

Your wallet is where your trading money lives. We use the Solana network because it’s fast and has low fees.

- Open the Solana Wallet tab in the app.
- New wallet: Click “Generate New Wallet” to make a private, encrypted key file just for the app.
- Existing wallet: Click “Connect Existing” if you already have a Solana wallet.
- Secret password: Choose a strong passphrase. This protects your private keys. Write it down and keep it somewhere safe. Don’t share it with anyone.
- Fund it: Send a small amount of SOL or USDC to the wallet address shown in the app. Start with the minimum—this first trade is a test.

## 3) Meet Your Bouncer (Your Safety Net)

The bot uses a built‑in safety guard called the Kraken Compliance Layer. Imagine a bouncer at a club checking IDs—it screens tokens before you trade.

- Blocks scams (like honeypots you can buy but can’t sell) and shady contracts.
- Limits how much you can trade on risky, unverified tokens.
- Runs automatically—you don’t need to manually audit anything.

Your job here: nothing. The bot filters out junk so you can focus on simple, safer trades.

## 4) Make Your First Trade (Keep it Tiny!)

Ready for the moment? We’ll make a small trade using the bot’s safety checks.

- Switch modes: In the main window, change Market Mode from “Simulation (Paper Mode)” to “Live Market Mode.”
- Find a token: Open the Axiom.trade Discovery tab.
  - Look for tokens with real trading volume and a positive trend.
  - Avoid brand‑new, illiquid tokens.
- Set the size: Use the smallest Position Size possible. Today is about proving the system works—not chasing a big win.
- Action: Click to execute the trade.
- Watch: The Real‑Time Monitoring panel shows your profit/loss (P&L), compliance status, and position updates. Let the bot do the complex stuff while the safety layer keeps guard.

## 5) Know the Emergency Exit

Safety first. Know how to stop, fast.

- Emergency Controls are in the main window:
  - Activate Kill Switch: Your big STOP sign. Stops new trades immediately and applies strict safety rules to anything open.
  - Emergency Stop: Full bailout. Closes all current positions and shuts the bot down.

After your first successful live trade, we recommend switching Market Mode back to Simulation (Paper Mode) to test new ideas safely with zero risk.

You did it! 🎉 One small, safe trade—mission accomplished. Come back tomorrow with the same game plan: start tiny, let the safety layers protect you, and use those emergency buttons if anything feels off.
